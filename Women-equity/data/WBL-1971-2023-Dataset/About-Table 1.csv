Women, Business and the Law 2023;;;;
Data for 1971-2023;;;;
"By developing a time series and further researching the interaction between inequality of opportunity for women and labor market dynamics, the World Bank's Women, Business and the Law project strengthens insights into how women’s employment and entrepreneurship are affected by legal gender discrimination, and in turn how this affects economic outcomes. 

This file contains Women, Business and the Law (WBL) panel data for 190 economies for report years 1971 to 2023. The data for each report year is current as of the previous calendar year. For example WBL2023 data is current as of October 1, 2022. Data is provided for 35 data points across 8 scored indicators. The WBL index scores are based on the average of each economy’s scores for the 8 topics included in the aggregate score. A higher score indicates more gender equal laws. The scores for previous years have been recalculated to account for data revisions. 

The ‘WBL Panel 2023’ sheet presents the full panel dataset, for the reporting years 1971 to 2023, 190 economies, 8 indicators, and 35 questions. The subsequent sheets present the panel data by indicator. These also include the panel data of legal references used to assign a score to each question under the given indicator. 

The file presents additional unscored data points, under the Parenthood indicator and in the overall WBL Panel 2023 dataset, to give further details or context; the headers of such unscored data points are marked according to the legend below.
